                Machine learning (ML) has emerged as an effective tool for
                achieving this aim, providing data-driven insights and
                automated procedures that can increase productivity and
                lower environmental footprints [3]. Here's a summary of the
                literature addressing how ML is influencing firms in waste
                management, resource use, and energy consumption.</p>
            <h4>A. Related work</h4>
            <p>Businesses face increasing pressure to reduce their
                environmental effect. Excessive waste generation, resource
                consumption, and energy consumption hurt the environment
                while also straining finances and impeding competitiveness.
                Fortunately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a strong
                tool, enabling organizations to navigate towards a more
                sustainable future [4]. Businesses face a vital crossroads:
                limit their environmental impact or face rising pressure from
                consumers, regulators, and the earth itself. Fortunately,
                machine learning (ML) emerges as a knight in shining armor,
                offering data-driven solutions to combat waste generation,
                resource consumption, and energy usage [5]. ML is
                transforming businesses for a sustainable future.</p>
            <h4>B. Machine learning for waste management: A review.
                Neurocomputing</h4>
            <p>ML algorithms can forecast waste generation based on
                operational data such as sales figures, production schedules,
                and seasonal patterns [6]. This allows firms to optimize
                sourcing, logistics, and production planning while reducing
                unnecessary waste. By examining customer behavior and
                market trends, ML may predict demand for products and
                services. This allows businesses to optimize production
                volumes, preventing overproduction and consequent waste
                generation [7].</p>
            <h4>C. Waste prediction using machine learning for smart
                waste management in smart cities.</h4>
            <p>ML algorithms can assess energy consumption patterns
                and forecast future energy requirements. This allows
                businesses to deploy smart energy management systems,
                such as dynamic pricing, demand response tactics, and
                automated energy-saving measures, which result in
                significant energy savings [8]. Utilizing machine learning
                can aid in optimizing the incorporation of renewable energy
                sources such as solar and wind into power systems. This
                increases renewable energy use while decreasing reliance on
                fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. ML can forecast
                equipment breakdowns based on sensor data, allowing for
                preventative maintenance programs [9]. This lowers
                downtime, saves energy owing to inefficient processes, and
                increases equipment longevity.</p>

            <h4>D. Deep learning for smart waste sorting: A review. Waste
                Management</h4>
            <p>Machine learning-powered image recognition and sensor
                based systems can accurately categorize and sort various
                types of waste [10]. This facilitates efficient recycling and
                waste disposal, reducing landfill contributions and promoting
                circular economy practices. By avoiding waste, improving
                resource utilization, and lowering energy consumption, machine learning can drastically lower operating costs for
                enterprises [11].
                Overall, the literature review provided a comprehensive
                literature review to establish the theoretical foundation and
                contextualize the project within existing knowledge.</p>
            <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
            <p>In this section, we outline the methodology employed to
                investigate Environmental Impact of Businesses for making
                Businesses more sustainable. The methodology encompasses
                the research strategy, structure, data collection methods, data
                analysis methods, and ethical considerations:</p>

            <h4>A. Research Approach</h4>
            <p>The research approach will involve a hybrid approach,
                merging quantitative analysis with qualitative methods
                investigation to comprehensively assess the environmental
                impact of businesses [12]. Quantitative analysis will entail
                statistical methods and data visualization techniques applied
                to datasets on waste generation, resource consumption, and
                energy usage. This quantitative aspect will provide insights
                into trends, patterns, and correlations within the data [13].
                Additionally, qualitative investigation will involve in-depth
                examination of the implications of these findings for
                environmental sustainability, considering factors such as
                waste management practices, resource efficiency, and energy
                consumption behaviors [14]. By combining quantitative and

                businesses and potential avenues for promoting sustainable
                practices [15].</p>
            <h4>B. Research Design</h4>
            <p>This research aims to analyze the environmental impact
                of businesses by examining waste generation, resource
                consumption, and energy usage data. Data will be collected
                from Kaggle and the Chicago Data Portal, covering waste
                generation, material footprint per capita, and energy
                consumption. After data collection, a thorough data cleaning
                process will be conducted to ensure data accuracy and
                relevance [16]. Analysis methods will include visualizations,
                statistical analysis, and environmental impact assessments.
                The results will be summarized, drawing conclusions about
                businesses' environmental impact and proposing future
                research directions for promoting sustainability [17].</p>
            <h4>C. Data Collection Methods</h4>
            <p>Businesses have a significant impact on the environment,
                which can be thoroughly examined through the analysis of
                waste generation, resource consumption, and energy usage.
                Each of these factors plays an essential role in understanding
                the environmental footprint of businesses and assessing their
                sustainability practices [18].
                Hence, we obtained data on Municipal Waste Generation
                from Kaggle, encompassing various types of waste
                originating from households, commercial enterprises, Office
                structures, establishments, small enterprises, yard and garden
                refuse, street sweeping residue, litter bin contents, and
                market cleaning refuse are categorized as household waste
                [19]. Notably, Waste originating from municipal sewage
                networks and treatment facilities, alongside debris generated
                from construction and demolition endeavors, are excluded
                from this definition. The measurement unit for this indicator
                includes thousand tonnes and kilograms per capita.
                Subsequently, we accessed data on Resource
                Consumption in the form of Material Footprint per capita (in
                tonnes) spanning the years 1990 to 2021 from Kaggle. This
                dataset offers a comprehensive historical overview of per
                capita material footprint, facilitating an analysis of global
                resource consumption patterns [20]. It includes crucial
                columns including ISO3 (country/territory ISO3 code),
                Country (name of the country or territory), Continent
                (geographic region), Hemisphere (hemisphere where the
                country is located), together with Material Footprint data for
                the years from 1990 to 2021. These records serve as a
                valuable asset for investigating shifts in resource
                consumption and their environmental ramifications over
                time, thereby enhancing our comprehension of global
                sustainability and resource utilization trends.
                Finally, we acquired a dataset on Energy Usage from the
                Chicago Data Portal, which presents various measures of
                energy consumption for residences, businesses, and
                industries within the city during the year 2010 [21]. The data,
                derived from ComEd and Peoples Natural Gas and
                aggregated by Accenture, encompasses 88 percent of the
                buildings in Chicago for 2010, with electricity accounting for
                68 percent of total electrical usage and gas representing 81
                percent of gas consumption within the city for the same year.
                Census blocks with fewer than four accounts are aggregated
                at the Community Area level without additional geographical
                identifiers [13]. Additionally, this dataset includes specific
                variables delineating characteristics of the Census block
                population, physical housing, and occupancy.</p>

            <h4>D. Data Cleaning</h4>
            <p>Data cleaning is a crucial preliminary step before
                conducting analysis on datasets as it helps remove irrelevant
                features and handle missing values. We conducted data
                cleaning for three datasets: Waste Generation, Resource
                Consumption, and Energy Usage, to ensure they are ready
                for analysis.
                For the Energy Usage Dataset, we first filtered the data
                based on the "Building Type" attribute, focusing only on
                "Commercial" and "Industrial" buildings. We then selected
                relevant features related to electricity consumption, thermal
                consumption, renter information, and occupied units [22]. To
                address missing values, we replaced them with 0, ensuring
                completeness and consistency in the dataset.
                In the Resource Consumption dataset, we targeted the
                "Material Footprint per Capita" attribute. Irrelevant features
                such as "ISO3" and "Country" were discarded, leaving only
                the feature related to material footprint per capita in tonnes
                from 1990 to 2021. This streamlined the dataset for analysis,
                resulting in 32 relevant features out of 39.
                Lastly, for the Waste Generation dataset, which
                contained 35 features, we eliminated all categorical attributes
                as they were not relevant for our analysis focused on
                determining the amount of waste generated [23]. After
                removing unnecessary features, we addressed missing values
                in the remaining columns by replacing NaN values with their
                respective mean values, ensuring data completeness and
                accuracy.
                Overall, the data cleaning process facilitated the
                preparation of clean, concise, and relevant datasets for
                subsequent analysis [24]. By removing irrelevant features
                and handling missing values appropriately, the datasets are
                now ready for in-depth analysis to glean insights into
                environmental impact and business activities.</p>

            <h4>E. Analysis - Resource Utilization, Waste Production &
                Energy Consumption</h4>
            <p>A comprehensive analysis of three key datasets—
                Resource Consumption, Waste Production, and Energy
                Consumption—provides valuable insights into their
                individual contributions to environmental impact through
                various business activities for enhancing business
                sustainability. By comprehensively analyzing these three key
                datasets, businesses can gain valuable insights into their
                environmental impact across various activities. This data-
                driven approach enables informed decision-making aimed at
                enhancing business sustainability, aligning with
                environmental regulations, meeting stakeholder expectations,
                and ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future [25].
                Moreover, transparency in reporting and addressing
                environmental performance can also enhance brand
                reputation and competitiveness in increasingly

            <p>In examining Resource Consumption, visualizing
                Material Footprint per capita in tonnes from 1990 to 2021
                reveals distinct trends. There is a notable surge in resource
                consumption post-2000, followed by a period of relative
                stability from 2010 to 2020. This suggests a significant
                escalation in resource utilization, likely propelled by factors
                such as economic growth, industrialization, and
                globalization. the observed trends in Material Footprint per
                capita highlight the complex interplay between economic
                development, industrialization, and environmental
                sustainability. </p>

                <img src="../static/Images/5.JPG" alt="Description of the image" class="centered-image">

                <p>Turning to Energy Usage, a nuanced analysis reveals
                insights into electricity and thermal energy consumption
                patterns [26]. Industries demonstrate peak electricity usage in
                December, signaling heightened energy demand during year-
                end operations, possibly driven by increased production or
                seasonal factors. Similarly, patterns emerge in thermal
                energy consumption, with notable spikes during colder
                months (January, February, March, November, and
                December) and lower usage in warmer months (June, July,
                August, and September). These patterns align with seasonal
                variations in heating and cooling demands, reflecting both
                business activities and climate conditions. </p>

                <img src="../static/Images/6.JPG" alt="Description of the image" class="centered-image">

                <p>In Waste Generation analysis, attention is drawn to the
                composition of waste materials and waste sorting practices.
                Organic waste emerges as the primary component,
                comprising 35% of total waste generated, followed by paper.
                This underscores the predominance of biodegradable
                materials in business waste streams, posing challenges for
                effective waste management and environmental
                sustainability. Knowing of these insights will play crucial
                role in making a business a more sustainable business

                everything from household items and electronics to
                infrastructure and transportation.
                The analysis reveals that organic waste comprises the
                highest percentage (35%) of the total waste generated by
                businesses, followed by paper with 17%. The high
                percentages of organic and paper waste generated by
                businesses contribute to various environmental challenges,
                such as climate variation, pollution, depletion of resources,

                this is expected due to increased heating demands during
                colder weather, it also suggests that businesses may be
                relying heavily on non-renewable energy sources for heating
                purposes, which can lead to higher emissions of greenhouse
                gases and air pollutants. Also the data indicates substantial
                electricity usage by businesses throughout the year, with
                varying levels from month to month. High electricity
                consumption can lead to increased demand for energy
                generation, which often relies on Fossil fuels like coal,
                natural gas, or nuclear energy, which are non-renewable.</p>
